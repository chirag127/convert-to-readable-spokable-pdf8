## Security Best Practices

As a client-side web application, security is a shared responsibility. While we implement robust security measures in the code, users and developers should also adhere to best practices:

*   **Keep your browser updated:** Ensure you are using the latest stable version of your web browser.
*   **Be cautious of third-party integrations:** If the application were to integrate with external services, users should verify the security of those services.
*   **Secure your development environment:** If you are contributing to the project, ensure your local development environment is secure, including keeping your operating system and development tools up to date.
